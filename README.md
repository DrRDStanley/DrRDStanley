- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DrRDStanley
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about text analysis and visualization techniques. (I'm very much a "newbie" to this area.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about text analysis methods, VSMs, and LDAs, specically as methods to apply to texts, broadly speaking, as a way of understanding meaning. My field is education.
- I am currently learning about Orange, Tableau, and Voyante - a seemingly eclectic mix of tools, to be sure. I'd like to explore questions of meaning in curriculum guides, e.g., ways of understanding the concept of "learning" and its different forms in which students are expected to demontrate what they know, can do, and value.
